  <h3> What is Protein?</h3>

  <p>
Protein is a macronutrient that provides the body with amino acids, which are the building blocks for muscle growth, and is considered an essential supplement by top bodybuilders. Protein is essential for a number of processes in the body including ones that support lean muscle mass, muscle growth, immune health and more. You can get your protein in many forms, including protein powders, ready-to-drink shakes and protein bars.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Protein Powder Types</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Whey:</strong> Whey is a complete protein, meaning it has all nine essential amino acids necessary for protein synthesis. Whey is a foundational supplement and supports a huge range of goals for both men and women. It’s fast-digesting and perfect for muscle building and fat loss in combination with a healthy diet and exercise.<br><br>

    <strong>Whey Isolate:</strong>  Whey protein isolate is whey protein that has been filtered to remove most of the fat, cholesterol, and lactose, delivering a purer protein that’s high in branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). This fast-absorbing protein is perfect to quickly refeed muscles after weight training.<br><br>

    <strong>Casein:</strong>  Casein is a dairy-based slow-digesting protein that supports leans muscle mass. Micellar casein protein is the top choice for muscle recovery around the clock. It’s ideal for a nighttime protein boost. <br><br>

    <strong>Plant-Based:</strong> Plant proteins are made from vegan sources like soy, hemp, pea, broccoli, sweet potato and brown rice. These vegetarian options are perfect for anyone who doesn’t want a milk-based protein or is looking for an alternative to other animal-based protein. These naturally lactose-free protein powders can be taken by anybody from a weekend warrior to a bodybuilder. <br><br>

    <strong>Soy:</strong> Soy protein is a complete source of protein and provides a complete amino acid profile. Soy protein is often included in plant-based protein formulas. <br><br>

    <strong>Egg:</strong> Egg protein is the most complete protein when compared to all other animal and plant-based sources. It is ideal for customers with dairy or lactose sensitives. Egg protein helps to build lean muscle and support recovery. <br><br>

    <strong>Protein Blends:</strong> Protein blends combine a number of protein sources to allow for a multi-phase protein release. Blends are able to customize macronutrient ratios and round out complete amino profiles.

  <h1> Creatine </h1>

    <h3> What is a Creatine?</h3>

  <p>
Creatine is basically a fuel source for ATP, which is an energy system used for short bursts of power. Supplementing with creatine may help delay fatigue too, which means that you can take your workouts to the limit. <br><br>
Creatine is formed in the human body from the amino acids methionine, glycine and arginine. The average person’s body contains approximately 120 grams of creatine stored as creatine phosphate. Certain foods such as beef, herring and salmon, are fairly high in creatine. However, a person would have to eat pounds of these foods daily to equal what can be obtained in one teaspoon of powdered creatine. 
  </p>

    <br>
    <h3> Types of Creatine</h3>
  <p>
    <br><strong>-Creatine monohydrate:</strong> It’s regarded as unbeatable for its ability to help your body’s muscles perform at their best and grow to their fullest. Micronized creatine monohydrate has smaller particles and is designed to absorb quickly, so it can get to work when you need it most. <br><br>
<strong>-Kre-Alkalyn</strong>, a buffered form of creatine processed at higher PH levels than regular creatine monohydrate, is believed to have one of the fastest absorption rates of all. <br><br>
-Additional formats include A-AKG, Ethyl-Ester and other blended options with various creatine types. Can be taken in multiple forms including pills and powders. You can take creatine daily on its own, before, during or after training. It can be mixed into a shaker cup with other pre-workout products, BCAAs, or even in your protein.
  </p>

    <br>
    <h3> Is Creatine Safe? </h3>
    <p>
      Creatine is one of the most widely-studied supplements, and studies indicate that creatine within recommended levels is safe for use. In a 2003 study, Dr. Kreider and his colleagues found that long-term creatine use (over a 21 month period) did not pose any problems for football athletes who took five grams a day, as compared to their non-using counterparts. Indeed, the athletes who did take creatine experienced very few side effects and had fewer episodes of cramping muscle tightness, muscle pulls, dehydration, illnesses and contact injuries.

  <h1> Pre-Workout </h1>

  <h3> What is a Pre-Workout?</h3>

  <p>
Pre-workout supplements include all the ingredients that people take with the goal of making workouts more effective. The name literally means it’s something you do prior to a workout, training, game, or match. The most common ingredients in today’s popular pre-workouts include Caffeine, Beta Alanine, BCAAs and Nitric Oxide Boosters like Arginine and Citrulline. Nitric oxide boosters help to increase blood flow and the “pump” feeling during a lift. There are also formulas designed with nootropics to help support focus. 
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3> Stimulant vs Non-Stimulant</h3>

  <p> Pre-workouts can be divided into two groups: those with stimulants, and those without. The stimulants pretty much always include caffeine, in widely varying doses, but may include other stimulants including yohimbine, theacrine (Teacrine as the most common), guarana, and many others. Many supplement companies have developed stimulant-free pre-workouts for those who are sensitive to caffeine, simply don’t want it, or who exercise close to bedtime.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3> How to pick your Pre-Workout</h3>

  <p>
    Because there are so many different types of pre-workouts available it’s important to ask yourself a few questions: <br>
<strong>– What time is your workout?</strong> If you’re getting an early morning workout you may be looking for a big stimulant or caffeine boost to kickstart your training. In that case you can go for a pre-workout with 100-300mg of caffeine. If you’re hitting a late night session you may want to go for a non-stim or stim-free pump product. <br>
<strong>– What type of workout?</strong> For strength workouts you may want to look for a pre-workout with creatine to support power and performance and BCAAs to support lean muscle mass. For cardio workouts you may want to look for a pre-workout with an electrolyte blend and a carbohydrate source to help power your long runs and replenish your glycogen stores.
  </p>  

  <br>
  <h3> Do Pre-Workouts work?</h3>

  <p>
    Yes. While there are clinical studies around the individual ingredients supporting muscle growth, strength and size, the goal of the pre-workout is to give you the energy, endurance and focus to complete your training. A pre-workout can help you to have a better workout, but that’s just one factor. You need the proper training, nutritional foundation and sleep to reach your goals. Supplements are just one piece of the puzzle.

  <h1> Recovery </h1>

    <h3> The Importance of Muscle Recovery </h3>

    <p>
      Workout recovery is arguably as important as the workouts themselves. Any time you push muscle past its normal level, it creates a tiny tear in the muscle tissue. It is the repair of this tear that leads to muscle growth. If the muscle isn't allowed to recover, you won't see gains in muscle mass. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Supplements for Muscle Recovery</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Protein supplement.</strong> Protein is perhaps the most useful supplement for muscle recovery. It helps the muscle repair faster and more effectively after a grueling workout. It is even more important if there isn't enough protein in the diet.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplement.</strong> Though the body can make some amino acids on its own, there are a few it cannot make. A BCAA supplement provides these essential amino acids. This aids in recovery. This type of supplement also promotes muscle growth while reducing muscle fatigue.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fatty acid supplement.</strong> Another good supplement for muscle recovery is fatty acids. They supply energy, but also reduce inflammation. A medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) fatty acid helps by reducing lactic acid buildup. An omega 3 fatty acid reduces muscle fatigue and muscle soreness. It also offers injury protection.<br><br>
